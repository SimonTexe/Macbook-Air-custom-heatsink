Make this possible, anything is appreciated!: https://gofund.me/4c91f224 

Here is the current progress on the custom heatsink for MacBook Air! 

Make measurements of the current m1 macbook air heatsink: Ongoing
Current update of this step:
The heatsink material has been figured out, its made of aluminum. The thermal compound to be used has to be figured out. Leaning towards a paste like mx-6 or paste alike. Due to the LIM being very reactive to the mac frame it would just be very messy to use. 
The measurements is comming next, due to the lack of tools i have available. But thanks to all the donations I will now order some tools for this project!

Making a 3d model of the heatsink: To be done

Make a new modded 3d design: To be done

Make a 3d print of the new design: To be done
